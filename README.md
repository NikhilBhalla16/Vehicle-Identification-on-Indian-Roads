# Vehicle Identification on Indian Roads 

This project focuses on enhancing road safety and traffic management on Indian roads. Leveraging a custom dataset curated for the unique complexities of the Indian traffic landscape, we employed YOLOv7, to develop a real-time image recognition model. It has applications in various fields like traffic management, public safety and urban planning.
